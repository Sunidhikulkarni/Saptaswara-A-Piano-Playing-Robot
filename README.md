# Saptaswara--Piano-Playing-Robot
People love pleasant music, but who will play it for
them all the time? Music therapy and rehabilitation
centers are in need of economical ways of playing
music and are slowly switching to mobile phones for
music, but mobile phones are not the natural source
of music and moreover, the radiations from these
devices are causing more harm than benefit. To
address these issues the possible solution could be to
automate musical
instruments to play the music
without the aid
of musicians
in
an easy
and
economical way.
